style: gtest
purpose: Generate meaningful unit tests for the given C++ code using Google Test.
guidelines:
  - Create a test file using Google Test
  - Only test public interfaces or entry points.
  - Avoid redundant or duplicate tests.
  - Assume all necessary includes and dependencies exist.
  - Do not reject code because of missing include paths.
  - Do not fail on unknown includes. Skip or mock them.
  - Do not reject files with third-party dependencies.
  - Focus only on function signatures and logic, not buildability.
  - You can ignore the headers if necessary.
  - Focus on logic inside the functions and methods.
  - Include appropriate headers and mocks.
  - Use Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) pattern in each test case.
  - Cover all functions and edge cases.
output:
  format: cpp
  include_headers: true
